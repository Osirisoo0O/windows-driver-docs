# StorPortBuildIo rule (storport)


This rule verifies that if the StorPort miniport's **StorPortBuildIo** routine returns **FALSE**, the SRB in question is not passed to **StartIo**. (In such cases, the miniport driver must complete the SRB by calling [**StorPortNotification**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567433) with a notification type of **RequestComplete** from **StorPortBuildIo** or someplace else).

> [!NOTE]
> This rule is testing StorPort's correct operation, not the miniport's.
